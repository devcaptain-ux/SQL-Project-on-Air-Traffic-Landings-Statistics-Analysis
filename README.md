# SQL-Project-on-Air-Traffic-Landings-Statistics-Analysis

Project Description
This project aims to analyze air traffic landings statistics using SQL to extract meaningful insights about airline operations, aircraft models, and regional traffic patterns. The dataset contains detailed information about landings, including the operating airline, aircraft details, and geographical regions.

Key SQL Queries
1. Total Landings and Total Landed Weight by Airline (This query calculates the total number of landings and the total landed weight for each airline.)

2. Average Landings and Landed Weight by Aircraft Model(This query calculates the average number of landings and the average landed weight for each aircraft model.)

3.Distinct Aircraft Models in Europe(This query lists distinct aircraft models that operate in Europe.)

4.Airline with the Most Landings(This query identifies the airline with the highest number of landings.)

5.Record with Maximum Total Landed Weight(This query retrieves the record with the highest total landed weight.)

6.Total Landings and Weight by Region(This query calculates the total number of landings and total landed weight for each geographical region.)

7.Airlines Containing 'Air' in Their Name(This query retrieves all records where the operating airline's name contains the word 'Air'.)

8.Length of Airline Names(This query calculates the length of each airline's name.)

9.Frequency of Aircraft Models by Airline(This query counts the frequency of each aircraft model used by each airline and identifies the most frequently used model.)

10.Traffic Category by Airline(This query categorizes airlines based on the total number of landings.)

11.Recursive Query for Active Period Sequence(This query generates a sequence of active periods from January 2024 to December 2024 using a recursive CTE.)

12.Dense Rank of Airlines by Total Landings(This query calculates the dense rank of airlines based on their total number of landings.)



Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of SQL for analyzing air traffic data, providing valuable insights into airline performance, aircraft usage, and regional traffic patterns. The queries cover a wide range of analytical tasks, from calculating aggregates and averages to ranking and categorization, showcasing the power of SQL in data analysis.
